    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "That's a great project idea! A personal finance tracker can really streamline your budgeting process. What features are you thinking about including? Would you want automatic bank import, manual entry, or both?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Ideally automatic import, but I know that's complicated with bank APIs. Maybe I could start with CSV import from my bank exports. The main thing I need is automatic categorization of transactions - that's what takes me forever."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "CSV import is a practical starting point. For automatic categorization, you could use rule-based matching initially (merchant name contains 'Amazon' -> Shopping), then potentially add ML-based categorization later. What tech stack are you comfortable with?"

    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "I've been learning Python lately and I've played around with pandas for data analysis. I was thinking maybe a simple web interface with Flask or FastAPI."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Python with pandas is perfect for this! FastAPI would be great for the backend - it's modern and has good async support. For the frontend, you could use something simple like Jinja templates to start, or a lightweight framework like HTMX for interactivity."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "That sounds doable. The frustrating thing is I've tried apps like Mint and YNAB but they never categorize things the way I want. I have very specific categories for my side business expenses that those apps don't handle well."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "Custom categories for side business expenses is a great reason to build your own. You can define exactly the taxonomy that makes sense for your situation. Would you want to track business vs personal separately, or have them in one unified view?"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Unified view but with clear separation. I need to be able to generate reports for tax time that just show business expenses. Oh, and I'd love charts showing spending trends over time."
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "So the core features would be: CSV import, custom categorization rules, business/personal tagging, exportable reports for taxes, and trend visualization. That's a well-scoped MVP! Pandas plus matplotlib or plotly would handle the charting nicely."
